    "completion_status": "Completed",
    "problem_importance": "Fake news spreads 6x faster than truth on social media, influencing elections and public health. Manual checking is impossible at scale.",
    "key_contribution": "A novel hybrid model combining BiLSTM and Attention mechanism that outperforms state-of-the-art by 4%.",
    "key_results": "Achieved 94.2% accuracy on the ISOT Fake News dataset, reducing false positives by 12%.",
    "background_info": "Fake news detection involves classifying text as real or fake. Traditional methods use linguistic features; modern approaches use deep learning.",
    "specific_problem": "Existing models struggle with short-text social media posts and sarcastic content, leading to high false negative rates.",
    "objectives": "1. Develop a deep learning model robust to short text. 2. Integrate attention to focus on key keywords. 3. Evaluate on benchmark datasets.",
    "related_approaches": "1. CNN-based models (Wang et al.). 2. LIAR dataset benchmarks. 3. SVM with TF-IDF.",
    "prior_limitations": "CNNs lose sequential context. SVMs require manual feature engineering. Most methods fail on context-dependent sarcasm.",
    "comparison_baselines": "Standard CNN, BiLSTM without attention, BERT-base.",
    "approach_overview": "We propose 'Attn-FakeNet', a deep learning model using word embeddings, a BiLSTM layer for sequence modeling, and a self-attention layer to weigh important words.",

    "result_interpretation": "The attention mechanism successfully identifies 'clickbait' words, improving detection of sensationalist fake news.",
    "comparison_analysis": "Our model outperforms BERT-base by 1.5% in accuracy while being 5x faster for inference, making it suitable for real-time deployment.",
    "current_limitations": "Struggles with very long documents (>2000 words). Only trained on English text.",
    "future_work": "Extend to multi-lingual detection using XLM-R. Incorporate user-network features (social graph).",
    "conclusion_summary": "We presented Attn-FakeNet. It solves short-text detection issues. Achieved SOTA results. validated importance of attention in fake news.",
